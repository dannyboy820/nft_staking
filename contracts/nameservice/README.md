# Name Service

This is a CosmWasm derivation of [Cosmos SDK's name service application](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/nameservice/tutorial/01-app-design.html)

The goal of the application you are building is to let users buy names and to set a value these names resolve to.
The owner of a given name will be the current highest bidder. In this section, you will learn how these simple
 requirements translate to application design.

Here is the tutorial for this application: [tutorial](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/0.14/learn/name-service/intro.html)
